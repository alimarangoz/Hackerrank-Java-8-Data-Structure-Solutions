    public static void inOrder(Node root) {
        
        if(root != null){
            inOrder(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.data + " ");
            inOrder(root.right);
        }

    }

The base case is that i want to reach the leaf node and there is no more node to explore, at that point of time recursion starts to wind down


The in-order traversal consists of first visiting the left sub-tree, then the root node, and finally the right sub-tree.

Time complexity = O(n)
